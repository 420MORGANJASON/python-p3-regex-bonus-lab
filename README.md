# RegEx Lab

## Learning Goals

- Validate input using regular expressions.
- Search for patterns using regular expressions.

***

## Key Vocab

- **Regular Expression**: a sequence of characters used to search for a pattern
inside of a string.
- **Pattern**: a description of sequences of characters that share certain
traits with one another. Sequences do not need to be the same length or share
any common characters to pattern match. Also called a **filter**.

## Instructions

This is a **test-driven lab**. Run `pipenv install` to create your virtual
environment and `pipenv shell` to enter the virtual environment. Then run
`pytest -x` to run your tests. Use these instructions and `pytest`'s error
messages to complete your work in `regex.py` in the `lib` folder.

This lab is meant to give you experience with writing patterns for regular
expressions and using the `re` module to check your pattern against different
strings.

- Run `pytest -x` to execute the first test. This will check your RegEx against
  the string `"It's such a lovely day today."`
- Once you've written 

Once all of your tests are passing, commit and push your work using `git` to
submit.
